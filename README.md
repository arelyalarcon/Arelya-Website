Hi! My name is Arely Alarcon, I was born in Los Angeles, CA and I identify as nonbinary folx. My favorite hobbies is to read court briefs and to play the tenor saxophone.  I find court briefs the source of how society functions by restricting conduct to protect certain rights and issues at stake. For this reason, I decided to focus my interests and career path in my current major, Political Science.
